# capitals-quiz
This is a portfolio project, which, as the name suggests, gives the user a chance to test their knowledge of the US state capitals. I am using HTML, CSS, & JavaScript to build it. I plan to make it mobile-responsive as well & publish it through GitHub Pages.
To play, the user clicks the 'Let's Go!' button on the initial page, then answers the multiple-choice questions as to what the capital of the given state is. Upon loading of each question, two buttons appear at the bottom, one of which is the 'Reset Game', which, upon clicking, goes back to the first page the site loads & resets the score & user's progress. The other button that displays at the bottom is the 'Next' button, which is initially disabled. Upon clicking any of the four options, the 'Next' button displays, & the user can proceed to the next question. Depending on if they answered correctly, the user gets immediate feedback & an update on their current score for the round. Also, the number of questions answered out of 50 appears at the top of each question. With each round, the options for each question are randomly ordered, adding that much more to the difficulty of the game.
